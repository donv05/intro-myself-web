                        I have 10 years of experience working with youth agencies. I have a bachelor’s degree in 
                        outdoor education. I raise money, train leaders, and organize units. I have raised over $100,000 each of the last six years. 
                        I consider myself a good public speaker, and I have a good sense of humor. “Who do you know who works with youth?”
